    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the computational effort required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is, particularly when dealing with large datasets.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute relative to the input size. For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) scales linearly with the size of the input.</p>
